These scientists investigate the relationships between trees, wildlife, soil, water, and climate. By conducting field studies, collecting data, and analyzing samples, forest ecologists contribute valuable insights into conservation and sustainable management practices. They also assess the impact of human activities, such as logging and development, on forest health and biodiversity. Forest ecologists work closely with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and landowners to develop strategies that protect and preserve these vital ecosystems for future generations.
