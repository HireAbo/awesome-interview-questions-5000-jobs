Veterinary Medicine is a broad field that encompasses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries in animals. Within this discipline, Veterinary Nursing focuses specifically on the care and management of animals under the supervision of a veterinarian. Veterinary nurses play a crucial role in various aspects of animal healthcare, including administering medication, assisting in surgeries, conducting laboratory tests, and providing post-operative care. Animal Health Technicians, on the other hand, specialize in maintaining the overall health and well-being of animals. They are responsible for various tasks such as monitoring animal behavior, administering vaccinations, conducting physical examinations, and educating pet owners about animal care. Both professions require a deep love and understanding of animals, as well as excellent communication and technical skills.
